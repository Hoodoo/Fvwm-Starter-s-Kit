#  In this file individual styles for
#  applications are defined.

#  'Style' means almost every aspect
#  of controlling the window: decorations,
#  layers, desktop or page it starts on,
#  wether it is shown in window list or not,
#  focus policy etc.

#  Some basic styles are defined here, add
#  ones of your own if you need.
