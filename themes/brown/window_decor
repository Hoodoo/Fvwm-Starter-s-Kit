#  Below I will write rather simple
#  multipixmap window decoration.
#
#  I'm going to have pixmaps for 
#  left edge of titlebar, rest of 
#  titlebar and four pixmaps for buttons - 
#  I use pretty boring _[]X layout,
#  having the rest of functions on
#  hotkeys and as window menu entries.
#
#  I am going to have different 
#  set of decorations for active 
#  and inactive windows, which
#  makes 12 pixmaps total.
#
#  One can write more complicated 
#  or simple themes - eleven pixmaps
#  can be used for titlebar alone, 
#  tiled or stretced, pixmap or vector
#  pictures can be set for all ten 
#  buttons fvwm allows to have on the
#  titlebar, separate picture for 
#  each of button states.
#
#  As usual, refer to manuals for 
#  list of all options fvwm suggests.
#
#  Back to my theme, though. 

#  Let's start with the titlebar, 
#  tiling the pixmaps left to right.
#  I would, for simplicity, name 
#  the pixmaps like StateWhereItGoes.xpm
#
#  I would use xpm to be able to change
#  colors with simple script in future,
#  but fvwm has png support as well.
#
#  Let's set titlebar height (optional)
#  first and make window title left
#  aligned (also optional)

TitleStyle Height 16 
TitleStyle LeftJustified

#  Now we know what height the titlebar 
#  has (set up a nice looking font
#  in fonts file in this folder)

TitleStyle Active MultiPixmap LeftEnd AdjustedPixmap LeftEndActive.xpm Main AdjustedPixmap MainActive.xpm RightEnd AdjustedPixmap RightEndActive.xpm
TitleStyle Inactive MultiPixmap LeftEnd AdjustedPixmap LeftEndInactive.xpm Main AdjustedPixmap MainInactive.xpm RightEnd AdjustedPixmap RightEndInactive.xpm 

#  And button styles are written the similar way:

ButtonStyle 6 Active AdjustedPixmap 6Active.xpm
ButtonStyle 6 Inactive AdjustedPixmap 6Inactive.xpm
ButtonStyle 4 Active  AdjustedPixmap 4Active.xpm
ButtonStyle 4 Inactive AdjustedPixmap 4Inactive.xpm
ButtonStyle 2 Active AdjustedPixmap 2Active.xpm
ButtonStyle 2 Inactive AdjustedPixmap 2Inactive.xpm  
ButtonStyle 1 Active AdjustedPixmap 1Active.xpm
ButtonStyle 1 Inactive AdjustedPixmap 1Inactive.xpm

#  Set border width and handle width
#  They should be the same, or else 
#  greater value is used.

Style * BorderWidth 2
Style * HandleWidth 2

#  IMPORTANT! Colorset numeration
#  convention given in manuals is:
#    0 = Default colors
#    1 = Inactive windows
#    2 = Active windows
#    3 = Inactive menu entry and menu background
#    4 = Active menu entry
#    5 = greyed out menu entry (only bg used)
#    6 = module foreground and background
#    7 = hilight colors

#  Keeping this in mind, define colorsets 
#  for window borders: 

BorderStyle Active Colorset 8 -- flat 
BorderStyle Inactive Colorset 9 -- flat
Colorset 8 bg #00875f
Colorset 9 bg #647C75

#  One more thing to specify here is 
#  colors in which window titles are
#  written - again, different for active
#  and inactive windows: 

Style "*" HilightFore #00af5f
Style "*" Color #5f8787

#  Get rid of 3d everywhere - if 
#  it's not done, we will have our
#  pixmaps on the top surface of 
#  pseudo3d button.

TitleStyle -- flat
ButtonStyle All Active -- flat
ButtonStyle All Inactive -- flat
