#  Here the titlebar buttons
#  behaviour is defined. 
#  This file is in theme subfolder
#  because one might want a button 
#  pixmap matching it's function.
#  
#  I propose to keep all bindings to 
#  titlebar buttons here. 
#  
#  Simple commands can be issued 
#  as shown below.
# 
#  The buttons enumeration goes like
#  1 3 5 7 9  Titlebar  0 8 6 4 2
#  
#  As you can see, this theme uses 
#  pretty normal buttons layout _[]X
#  with quite expectable buttons behaviour.
#  
#  One more button would summon the window
#  menu (which is defined in a window_menu
#  file)

Mouse 1 2 N Delete
Mouse 1 4 N Maximize 100 100
Mouse 1 6 N Iconify

#  Make sure you can deiconify an iconified
#  window somehow.

Mouse 1 I N Iconify

Mouse 1 1 A Menu WindowMenu

#  Note that you can bind literally anything 
#  to your window decoration buttons.
