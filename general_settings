#  Couple of settings you would
#  definitely need:
#  
#  Ignore CapsLock and NumLock
#  modifiers so that they do not 
#  mess up your configuration:

IgnoreModifiers 2L

#  Resize and move windows instead
#  of 'borders':

OpaqueMoveSize unlimited
Style * ResizeOpaque

#  IndexedWindowName - to make sure
#  each window name is unique so 
#  further window manipulations would
#  be more precise:

Style * IndexedWindowName

#  Get rid of applications icons

Style * !Icon

#  Hides the position or size window that is 
#  usually shown when a window is moved or resized interactively
