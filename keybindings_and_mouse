#  fvwm's special: the keybindings.
#  The syntax is 
#  Key (optionally - window name) Your_Key_Name Context Modifier Action
#
#  - You can optionally define a hotkey depending on active window
#  title.
#  Type the exact window title or use symbols and wildcards in brackets,
#  e.g. (gedit) or (*edit*).
#
#  - Your_Key_Name is any key except for modifiers, name can be obtained
#  using xev except for PrtSc which is Print
#
#  - Contexts understood by fvwm are:
#
#  R - Root window
#  I - Iconified window
#  F - window decoration corner
#  S - window decoration side
#  T - window decoration title
#  W - active window
#  0-9 - titlebar buttons (see corresponding file)
#  M - Menu
#  A - any context
#
#  You can combine contexts: FWST etc.
#
#  - Modifiers are:
#  ctrl - C
#  super - 4
#  alt - 1
#  shift - S
#  caps - L
#  num - 2
#
#  Again, you can combine modifiers: 1S, 4S, etc. 
#  
#  If you use multiple desktops, set desktop switching 
#  here, the command is GotoDesk 0...n
#  Here are some bindings to manage your windows and
#  launch some applications, but you can set much
#  more of them and tune them really fine.
#  Use Exec exec to run applications.

#  Window management and general purpose 
#  hotkeys, couple of ideas come from crunchbanglinux:

Key F4 W M DeleteWin
Key Tab A M WindowList Root NoGeometry
Key M A M Module FvwmConsole
Key F2 A 1 Exec exec $[fvwm_runner]
Key Space A 4 Menu MainMenu
Key t W S4 WinOnTop
Key a W S4 ToggleAutoShaded
Key d W S4 UnDecorate
Key d W 4 Decorate
Key m W 4 Maximize 100 100
Key r W 4 ReadableWidth
Key i W 4 Iconify
Key F7 W 1 Move
Key F8 W 1 Resize
Key D W 4 Decorate

#  Playing with window title, making it go
#  to whatever side of the window we want:

Key Left W S4 WindowStyle TitleAtLeft
Key Right W S4 WindowStyle TitleAtRight
Key Up W S4 WindowStyle TitleAtTop
Key Down W S4 WindowStyle TitleAtBottom

#  Grouping windows and switching between
#  groups and inside them:
#
#  "Group" a grouped window once again 
#  to dismiss it.
#  
#  One window can belong to several groups.

Key 1 W C4 AddToGroup 1
Key 2 W C4 AddToGroup 2 
Key 3 W C4 AddToGroup 3
Key 1 A 4 GroupSwitch 1 
Key 2 A 4 GroupSwitch 2
Key 3 A 4 GroupSwitch 3

#  Screenshots and screencasts made easy:

Key Print A N FvwmDesktopScreenshot

#  Launch an application if it's not 
#  running or raise its window if
#  there is one and switch between given
#  application's windows if there are two
#  or more.
#
#  The LaunchRaiseSwitch function takes
#  two parameters: window name typical 
#  for given application to tell its windows 
#  from all the rest and command launching the
#  application. The commands are defined in 
#  environmental_variables file so that you 
#  don't have to type them in here and there,
#  the window names here are for applications
#  I use, type in yours for these hotkeys to
#  work properly. As you can see, you can use
#  wildcards.

Key t A 4 LaunchRaiseSwitch urxvt $[fvwm_terminal] 
Key f A 4 LaunchRaiseSwitch *File*Manager $[fvwm_filemanager]
Key e A 4 LaunchRaiseSwitch *gedit $[fvwm_editor]
Key w A 4 LaunchRaiseSwitch *Namoroka $[fvwm_browser]
Key p A 4 LaunchRaiseSwitch *Sonata* $[fvwm_player]
Key g A 4 LaunchRaiseSwitch *GIMP gimp

#  These are pretty simple - they just launch 
#  an application, no matter if there is an instance
#  of it running.

Key t A C4 Exec exec $[fvwm_terminal]
Key f A C4 Exec exec $[fvwm_filemanager]
Key e A C4 Exec exec $[fvwm_editor]
Key w A C4 Exec exec $[fvwm_browser]
Key p A C4 Exec exec $[fvwm_player]
Key g A C4 Exec exec gimp

#  Quake-like terminal and quake-like fvwm console

Key Grave A C QLikeTerm $[fvwm_terminal] quake-term 1366 768 0 0
Key Q A 4 QLikeFvwmConsole  812 360 275 408

#  Mouse bindings are set the same way as
#  key bindings, look at the examples which 
#  make fvwm mimic mainstream window managers 
#  functionality

Mouse 2 R A Menu MainMenu
Mouse 1 R A WindowList Root NoGeometry
Mouse 1 T A TitleFunction

#  !! Note that mouse bindings concerning 
#  titlebar buttons are written in /themes/theme/titlebar
#  file !!

#  Key Left A 4 GoToPage 0 0
#  Key Right A 4 GoToPage 1 0
#  Key Left W S4 MoveToPage 0 0
#  Key Right W S4 MoveToPage 1 0

#  Getting multimedia keys to work.
#  Yes, fvwm can do that for you, ain't it cute?
