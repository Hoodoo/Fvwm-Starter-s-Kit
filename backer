#  FvwmBacker is a fvwm module which takes care
#  of your desktop wallpapers. 
#
#  Please mind that this file is not read by
#  default, see ./config for details.
# 
#  Here is the example of setting different wallpapers
#  for different desktop pages (see desktop file for 
#  crude explanation of fvwm desktop concept)
#  
#  The theme does not include wallpapers, so you'll 
#  have to type in paths of your own.
#  
#  You also have to make sure the images are .png
#  and their size fit your screen resolution 
#  for this to work.
