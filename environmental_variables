#  Please set your preferred applications
#  to list in the desktop menu, launch with
#  hotkeys etc.
#  
#  This would save you some time if you 
#  decide do use filemanager a instead of
#  filemanager b - you will only need to edit 
#  this file once instead of changing 
#  the file manager command in menu file, 
#  hotkeys file and whatever files you 
#  mention it in.

#  You can make use of it if you want to
#  use some icons in your menu and still
#  want to change your iconsets and make 
#  fvwm use the same iconset as your apps.
#
#  Not covered in this howto because of my 
#  poor understanding of gtk and kde iconset
#  anatomy. 

SetEnv fvwm_icons Faenza-Mint

#  This one is interesting.
#  The idea is to try to keep the parts of
#  config responsible for appearance apart 
#  from these responsible for functionality 
#  and keep them in subfolders of 'themes'
#  folder along with .xpm or .png files.
#  
#  See the _'gray'_ subfolder for some further
#  details.

SetEnv fvwm_theme DYLI

#  fvwm's reserved variable for paths
#  to all images folders it has to deal
#  with. You can use images from any other
#  folders in your configuration, but it is 
#  easier to set them here:

ImagePath $[FVWM_USERDIR]/themes/$[fvwm_theme]/decorations/:+:$[FVWM_USERDIR]/icons:$[FVWM_USERDIR]/panel/


ModulePath +:$[FVWM_USERDIR]/modules
