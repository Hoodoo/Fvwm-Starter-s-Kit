#  If you use multiple paged desktops, consider to
#  define the scroll 'step' (EdgeScroll), time the
#  mouse cursor should spend by the edge of the screen
#  to skip to the next page (EdgeResistance) and 
#  the edge thickness in pixels. 
#  Set edge thickness to zero to avoid mouse 
#  page switching
